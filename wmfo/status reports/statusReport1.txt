1) This week we figured out how to host our database on heroku, then update our database 
using python and the PyMongo API.

2) One challenge we faced was getting our heroku app to link to our github repo. 
We're having trouble making it so that changes get deployed to heroku whenever any of us push to github.

3) Our goals for next week are to begin filling out our database with the radio show data, 
figure out what algorithms we want to use (for calculating genre percentages), and start using git branches.

#Comments by Ming
* Fill database with a small sampling to start, not everything (thousands of entries)
* Last.fm is apparently no longer accepting enrollment for their API
* "figure out what algorithms " --this is important.
