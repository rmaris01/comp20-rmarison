Group 16: Status Report 3

1) This week we populated our databaes with radio show data.

   We almost completed the node.js program that lets our front-end pages 
   interact with the database.

   We started working on the front-end pages using Bootstrap.

2) The challenges we faced this week were making the node.js work properly
   and learning how to use Bootstrap.

3) Next week we will complete the front-end pages using Bootstrap and chart.js.
