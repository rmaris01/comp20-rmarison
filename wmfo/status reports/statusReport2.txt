Group 16: Status Report 2

1) This week we figured out the algorithm that calculates how much a playlist
   matches the queried genre(s).

   We also determined in which phase we will calculate the percentages and what 
   data we will store in MongoDB.

2) The challenges we faced this week were developing the algorithm that 
   reflects our thoughts on what a well-matched playlist should look like and
   deciding on where to run the calculations for good performance.

3) Next week we will populate our database with radio show data.

* "3) Next week we will populate our database with radio show data." --you can first create a spreadsheet, then export sheet to CSV, then import that into MongoDB. :)
